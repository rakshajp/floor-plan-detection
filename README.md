## Steps:

### Image Loading: 
Load an image file using OpenCV- image processing library.

### Grayscale Conversion: 
Loaded color image is converted into a grayscale image (cv2.cvtColor).

### Thresholding: 
Set a threshold on the grayscale image- Define a brightness level where pixels darker than a certain threshold become black, and pixels brighter become white.

### Contour Detection: 
Detect the contours or outlines of different objects in the image: Tracing the edges of things like rooms, walls, or furniture.

### Contour Drawing: 
Once the contours are found, we draw these outlines onto the original image.
#### Find Contours: 
Finds contours in the thresholded image using the cv.findContours() function. This function returns two outputs: contours (a list of all the contours in the image) and hierarchy (information about the image topology). The cv.RETR_TREE parameter retrieves all of the contours and reconstructs a full hierarchy of nested contours. The cv.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE parameter compresses horizontal, vertical, and diagonal segments and leaves only their end points.
#### Draw Contours: 
Draws the detected contours on the original image using the cv.drawContours() function. The -1 parameter means that all contours are drawn. The (0, 255, 0) parameter sets the color of the contours to green. The 3 parameter sets the thickness of the contour lines.

In the context of image processing and computer vision, a contour can be defined as a curve joining all the continuous points (along the boundary), having the same color or intensity. Contours are useful for shape analysis and object detection and recognition. In OpenCV, finding contours is like finding white objects from a black background.
We can adjust parameters in the contour detection process to find specific features in an image. For example, we can adjust the threshold value in the cv.threshold() function, the contour retrieval mode in the cv.findContours() function, and the contour approximation method in the cv.findContours() function. By adjusting these parameters, we can fine-tune the contour detection process to explore different outputs.
